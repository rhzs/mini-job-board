## 🎯 **Key Improvements: Data-Agnostic Design**

### ✅ **No Hardcoded Dependencies**
- **Removed hardcoded job IDs**: Tests dynamically discover available job data
- **No fixed search terms**: Tests try multiple search terms to find working data
- **Dynamic company/user discovery**: Tests adapt to any available data
- **Graceful empty state handling**: Tests skip when required data is unavailable

### ✅ **Easily Reproducible**
- **Works with fresh database**: Tests handle empty states gracefully
- **Works with populated database**: Tests use available data dynamically
- **No setup requirements**: No need to create specific test accounts or data
- **Environment independent**: Runs consistently in dev, staging, CI/CD
